# Icon Placeholder

This folder should contain the extension icons:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons using any image editor, or generate them online.

For now, the extension will work without icons (they're optional).

Suggested icon ideas:
- A calculator with a gavel
- A price tag with percentage symbol
- A simple "A" or "$" symbol
